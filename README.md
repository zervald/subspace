# Subspace

This is a space sandbox game made in Rust with the [Bevy engine](https://bevy.org/).

A spiritual successor to [Objects in Space](https://store.steampowered.com/app/824070/Objects_in_Space)
for those like me who whished the developers kept polishing this diamond in the rough.

## Progress

The game is still very early in development.
Most gameplay systems are still getting implemented. 
As of now, no vertical slice is really possible.

Once enough is done, a prototype will be [released](https://github.com/zervald/subspace/releases). 

## How to run it

To run from source, you'll need to follow the [Bevy setup instructions](https://github.com/zervald/subspace/releases), specifically to install dependencies.

Then `cargo run`
